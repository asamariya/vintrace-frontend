# Vintrace front end running instructions

Firstly, you need to make sure you have Node and npm installed. You can check by following commands from your terminal:

+ `node -v`
+ `npm -v`

If you don't have them installed, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install the LTS version. Once node is installed, you should have both node and npm, which you can check again using the above commands from terminal.

Please note: Before starting the front end server, it's important to start the back end server first, so that when we call the endpoints from the front end, we don't get an error. Please refer to the back end readme for instructions on how to start that server. 

To start the front end server:

1. Open terminal
2. Clone the repository from Github from terminal using `git glone git@github.com:asamariya/vintrace-frontend.git`
3. Navigate to the directory vintrace-frontend
4. Run `npm install`  to install all dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the server
6. Pres `Ctrl + C` to stop the server
